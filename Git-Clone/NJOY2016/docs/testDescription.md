## Test Problem 1

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/01/input)]

 This one runs on carbon to check `RECONR` for materials with no resonance parameters, to do Doppler broadening to 300K, to calculate heating KERMA and radiation damage, and to calculate the thermal scattering from graphite.  The pointwise (PENDF) results are converted into multigroup form.  The important things to look at are the various counts in `RECONR` and the multigroup values from `GROUPR` on the [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/01/referenceOutput).  To see even more detail, check the reference [PENDF file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/01/referenceTape25).

## Test Problem 2

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/02/input)]

 This is a demonstration of preparing a library for LMFBR applications using methods active in the 80's.  It is still useful for checking `RECONR` resonance reconstruction, Doppler broadening to more than one temperature, the generation of unresolved resonance data, and multigroup averaging with self shielding.  The `CCCC` output provides an alternative look at the cross sections and group-to-group matrices.  Pay attention to the output from `RECONR` to see if the same number of resonance points are produced.  Note the number of points at each temperature and the thermal quantities printed by `BROADR`.  The unresolved self shielding shows up in the `UNRESR` output and again in `GROUPR` and `CCCCR`.  The multigroup constants printed on the [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/02/referenceOutput) provide plenty of opportunities to check your installation.  For even more detail, check the reference [PENDF file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/02/referenceTape28).

## Test Problem 3

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/03/input)]

 This one demonstrates processing photoatomic data and the use of MATXS output files.  Newer versions of the photoatomic data are all on one file, rather than the two shown here.  Note that two materials are processed to show the limiting behaviors.  The multigroup constants printed by `GAMINR` on the [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/02/referenceOutput) can be checked.  Two different output formats are generated: the DTF format and the MATXS format.  The `DTFR` numbers are given on the listing.  `DTFR` also generates Postscript plots of its results; the [Postscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/03/referenceTape37) file has been converted to [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/docs/tests/03/referenceTape37.pdf) format for easy viewing.

## Test Problem 4

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/04/input)]

 This test problem computes cross section covariances using the `ERRORR` module for <sup>235</sup>U from ENDF/B-V.  The performance of `ERRORR` can be tested by looking at the values on the [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/04/referenceOutput).

## Test Problem 5

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/05/input)]

 This one demonstrates formatting covariance data using our "boxer" format, and it generates detailed Postscript plots of the variances and correlations.  The [Postscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/05/referenceTape35) file has been converted to [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/docs/tests/05/referenceTape35.pdf) form for easy viewing.

## Test Problem 6

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/06/input)]

 This case demonstrates and tests some of the features of the `PLOTR` and `VIEWR` modules.  The [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/06/referenceOutput) is not very interesting.  Look at [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/docs/tests/06/referenceTape32.pdf) for the results.

## Test Problem 7

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/07/input)]

 This example demonstrates the production of a library for the MCNP continuous-energy Monte Carlo code for <sup>238</sup>Pu from ENDF/B-IV.  Older versions of MCNP required a set of multigroup photon production tables to construct the 30x20 grid of photon emission bins used in those days.  This problem demonstrates how that was done, but the method is rarely needed these days.  Still, these results provide another useful set of tests for your installation.  The most interesting numbers are those in the `ACER` [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/07/referenceOutput).  We provide both the [PENDF file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/07/referenceTape26) and the [ACE file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/07/referenceTape26) to allow for very detailed checks.

## Test Problem 8

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/08/input)]

 This case was added to check the processing of a typical ENDF/B-VI material using Reich-Moore resonances and File 6 for energy-angle distributions.  Pay special attention to the resonance results as shown by the counts on the `RECONR` listing and the values on the [PENDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/08/referenceTape28) and [ACE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/docs/tests/08/referenceTape25) files.  In addition, check the energy-angle distributions as printed out by `ACER` on the [ACE file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/08/referenceOutput).

## Test Problem 9

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/09/input)]

 This one demonstrates the use of `LEAPR` to generate a scattering kernel for water.  We have used the ENDF physics model, but we reduced the alpha and beta ranges to make the case run faster with less output.  Note that `RECONR` and `BROADR` are run to prepare a base for the thermal data at 296K.  `THERMR` was run with its long printout option to provide plenty of numbers on the [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/07/referenceOutput) for comparisons.  For additional details, look at the actual `LEAPR` [output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/09/referenceTape24).

## Test Problem 10

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/10/input)]

 This sample problem demonstrates the production of unresolved resonance probability tables for MCNP.  We run both `UNRESR` and `PURR` using the same sigma0 grid to allow additional checks of both modules and to allow for comparisons between the deterministic and probabilistic approaches to computing Bondarenko cross sections.  We provide the [output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/10/referenceOutput) listing, the [PENDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/10/referenceTape28) file, and the [ACE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/10/referenceTape26) file.  Lots of results to check.

## Test Problem 11

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/11/input)]

 This one demonstrates the production of a library for the WIMS reactor lattice code using <sup>238</sup>Pu from ENDF/B-IV.  Check both `GROUPR` output and `WIMSR` in the [output file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/11/referenceOutput).  The [WIMS library file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/11/referenceTape27) produced is also provided.

## Test Problem 12

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/12/input)]

  This one shows how the gas production capability works with <sup>61</sup>Ni from ENDF/B-VI.  To see the detailed results for gas production, look for MT=203 and 207 in File 3 of the [PENDF tape](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/12/referenceTape22).  Also, check out the [plots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/docs/tests/12/referenceTape24.pdf) of resonance cross sections and gas production cross sections.

## Test Problem 13

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/13/input)]

  This case demonstrates the modern MCNP formats using <sup>61</sup>Ni from ENDF/B-VI.  Note that `ACER` is run twice, once to prepare the ACE file, and again to do consistency checking and to prepare detailed [plots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/docs/tests/13/referenceTape36.pdf). 

## Test Problem 14

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/14/input)]

  This problem was developed to demonstrate ACE incident proton data and the MCNPX charged-particle format.  Once again, two `ACER` runs are used to do checks and prepare [plots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/docs/tests/14/referenceTape36.pdf).

## Test Problem 15

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/15/input)]

  This problem demonstrates advanced covariance processing using <sup>238</sup>U from JENDL-3.3.  Covariances from resonance parameters are included.  Multiple `ERRORR`, `COVR`, `GROUPR`, and `VIEWR` runs are stacked together in order to generate covariances for the multigroup nubar (see [reference plot 45]()), the multigroup cross sections (see [reference plot 46]()), and for the elastic angular P1 angular coefficient (see [reference plot 47]()).  The script is complicated, but it is nice to get all the results in one run.

## Test Problem 16

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/16/input)]

  This problem is similar to 15, except it omits the `GROUPR` module, demonstrating that covariances can be calculated directly from PENDF data.  It also demonstrates some advanced plotting techniques.

## Test Problem 17

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/17/input)]

  This problem uses <sup>235</sup>U, <sup>238</sup>U, and <sup>239</sup>Pu from JENDL-3.3 in order to demonstrate cross-material covariances.  This run is pretty slow.

## Test Problem 18

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/18/input)]

  This problem demonstrates covariance processing for a secondary energy distribution.  An artificial version of <sup>252</sup>Cf was prepared, and the spontaneous fission spectrum covariances were produced.

## Test Problem 19

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/19/input)]

  This case is for a more modern actinide evaluation, <sup>241</sup>Pu from ENDF/B-VI.

## Test Problem 20

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/20/input)]

  This test case uses a preliminary ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation for <sup>35</sup>Cl, which uses the advanced Reich-Moore-Limited format for the resonances.  This allows more complex covariances to be represented.  In this case, covariances involving the (n,p) reaction are calculated.

## Test Problem 21

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/21/input)]
 
  This test case was developed to check if NaNs were "calculated" in `PURR`. This problem was discovered by Dave Brown and Paul Romano and was fixed in [Pull Request 18](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/18). This test was created in an attempt to prevent this from happening again. (No guarantees.)

## Test Problem 22

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/22/input)]

  This test is the LEAPR input for para H2 at 20 K from ENDF/B-VIII.0-beta4. The test checks the compatibility between the skold and coldh subroutines.

## Test Problem 23

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/23/input)]

  This test is the LEAPR input for BeO from ENDF/B-VI.8. The test checks the ability to process materials with secondary scatterers.

## Test Problem 24

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/24/input)]

  This test is essentially a standard NJOY input file for producing a continuous energy ACE file for Pu239 (it should be noted that `UNRESR` and `PURR` are omitted from this input file due to runtime constraints). The Pu239 evaluation associated to this test contains tabulated fission energy components in MF1 MT458 (a new format made available for ENDF/B-VIII.0). This test was designed to test this new feature in `HEATR`. This test also runs a double heatr run to detect the issue of reallocating arrays in a double heatr run encountered with NJOY 2016.21.

## Test Problem 25

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/25/input)]

  This test is essentially a standard NJOY input file for producing continuous energy thermal scattering ACE files for H in H2O. This test produces three ACE files, one for each iwt option value in `ACER`. This test is made in preparation of a fix proposed by D. Roubtsov to solve issues with cosines outside the [-1,1] range produced by `ACER` for thermal scattering files.

## Test Problem 26

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/26/input)]

  This test is used to check heatr results using an ENDF file without an MT458 section (fission energy release components) in MF1. This test was added in response to an issue introduced in NJOY 2016.21 involving such ENDF files.

## Test Problem 27

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/27/input)]

  This test is used to complete testing for the `ERRORR` module when processing MF35 covariances. Test 18 already has a test for this, but it uses an evaluation with a single covariance energy range (between 0 and 20 MeV). This test uses a Pu239 evaluation in which MF35 is composed of multiple covariance ranges. `ERRORR` is called twice in this run, once for the second range (between 5 and 6.5 MeV) and a second time using the -1 option with an efmean equal to 5.75 MeV (which should also be the second range). Both `ERRORR` runs should give the same results.

## Test Problem 28

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/28/input)]

  This test is used to test some of the options available to users when processing continuous energy data (iopt=1). There are currently three options (all defaulted to 1) concerning the user of law 61, whether or not detailed photons should be used and whether or not delayed neutron distributions should be smoothed to lower energies. The test consists of running `ACER` three times: once with the options defaulted, once with all options set to 1 explicitly and once with all options set to 0 explicitly. The first two ACE files should be identical.

## Test Problem 29

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/29/input)]

  This test is similar to test 28, but this one is for the smoothing option in `GROUPR`. The test consists of running `GROUPR` three times: once with the default smoothing option, once with the option set to 1 explicitly and once with the option set to 0 explicitly. The first two GENDF files should be identical.

## Test Problem 30

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/30/input)]

  This test is an addition to test 3 using `MATXSR`. While test 3 only uses photons, test 30 uses both neutrons and photons.

## Test Problem 31

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/31/input)]

  This test runs `PURR` for Pu240 from ENDF/B-VIII.0. This evaluation is one of the few that still gave negative cross sections in the probability tables for ENDF/B-VIII.0. In most cases, this behaviour is due to the fact that the original evaluation has an LSSF flag of 0 (MF3 contains background cross sections) and those background cross sections in the unresolved resonance region are negative (an example would be Na22). In the case of Pu240 however, the LSSF flag is set to 1 (MF3 contains the actual cross sections and the unresolved resonances should only be used for self-shielding). The negative cross section values in the probability table for this nuclide were due to the fact that the total cross section was actually lower than its components.

## Test Problem 32

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/32/input)]

  This test runs `THERMR` for each formatting option available for thermal scattering, being (E, E', μ) or (E, μ, E').

## Test Problem 33

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/33/input)]

  This test runs `LEAPR` for D(D2O) and O(D2O) from ENDF/B-VIII.0 at 283.0 K. These evaluations include the Skold approximation, which in the past had conflicts with the COLDH subroutine. The test also checks the capacity of running several instances of LEAPR in the same input file.

## Test Problem 34

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/34/input)]

  This test is added following a problem encountered when running `ERRORR` using a binary input ENDF and GENDF file. The `ERRORR` run crashed with a segmentation fault prior to NJOY 2016.34.

## Test Problem 35-42

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/35/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/36/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/37/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/38/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/39/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/40/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/41/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/42/input)]

  Tests 35 to 42 were added to test the inelastic and absorption competition flags determined by `PURR` and used in `ACER` to be included in ACE files. Previous versions of NJOY 2016 (prior to 2016.30) incorrectly handled these flags. NJOY only tested competition up to MT102 (neutron capture) and explicitly omitted checking reactions like MT103 (n,p) or MT107 (n,a). As a result, for some nuclides NJOY did not capture the competition flags properly, leading MCNP or other codes using probability tables to incorrectly calculate the total cross section in the unresolved resonance region.

  The tests cover all possible combinations of the competition flags (no competition, only inelastic competition, only absorption competition and both) for each possible value of the LSSF flag (0 or 1). These tests are related to test 31.

## Test Problem 43-44

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/43/input)]
[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/44/input)]

  Tests 43 and 44 were added to test an issue encountered when using `BROADR`. A high value of thnmax close to the upper energy value of the energy range lead to `BROADR` crashing. This appeared to happen when the actual temperature was zero (in that case, broadr will only thin the cross sections) and non zero (in which case broadr will apply broadening). Both cases needed their own fix so a specific test for each was added to detect this problem in the future.

## Test Problem 45

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/45/input)]

  This test was added following an issue identified in `GASPR` concerning the charged particle production cros ssections when the original ENDF tape does not contain the summation cross section when individual levels are present. This lead to double counting of these levels. This test was added to detect this problem in the future.

## Test Problem 46

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/46/input)]

  This test was added following a fix in `ERRORR`. NJOY set the number of subsections to be treated for MF34 to 1, even though the ENDF-6 format allows using more than 1 subsection in MF34. This test was added to detect this problem in the future.

## Test Problem 47

[[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njoy/NJOY2016/master/tests/47/input)]

  This test is added following a change in `GROUPR` for the MF6 MT18 part of the GENDF file. Versions prior to NJOY 2016.49 only gave the infinite dilute fission matrix, independent of the number of sigma0 values requested by the user. This test runs two `GROUPR` runs, one with only infinite dilute and another one with two sigma0 values (including infinite dilute). The test also contains `ERRORR` runs for MF35 covariances to verify that the `ERRORR` module still gives the same results (only infinite dilute data is used) when using either of the produced GENDF files.
