# Release Notes&mdash;NJOY2016
Given here are some release notes for NJOY2016. Each release is made through a formal [Pull Request](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pulls) made on GitHub. There are links in this document that point to each of those Pull Requests, where you can see in great details the changes that were made. Often the Pull Requests are made in response to an [issue](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues). In such cases, links to those issues are also given.

## [NJOY2016.65](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/224)
This release fixes a processing issue for the d+Pt184 from TENDL-2021 in ACER. Some logic issue lead to MT11 being ignored as a deuteron producing reaction and this lead to processing problems in ACER.

This release addresses issue [\#184](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/184) and [\#223](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/223).

## [NJOY2016.64](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/202)
This fixes a bug in ACER when producing photonuclear ACE files using some TENDL2019 evaluations. The use of LAW=4 in MF6 of these evaluations lead to corrupted ACE files related to incorrect logic in counting secondary particle producing reactions.

This release addresses issue [\#201](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/201).

## [NJOY2016.63](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/193)
This fixes a bug in ERRORR when using the `999` option. When using this option, the input and output tapes are not closed in Fortran. This causes problems in NJOY21 as the output from ERRORR isn't completely written to disk before the next module starts. This update simply closes files `nitape` and `notape` which resolves the issue.

In addition, some logic statements in the GROUPR conver and ACER convr subroutines have been corrected to fix failures in the test
suite when building in Debug mode.

## [NJOY2016.62](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/191)
This adds a number of changes to NJOY2016 contributed by Toshihiko Kawano, Bob McFarlane, IAEA and CIEMAT. In particular, the following changes were made:
  - fixed an issue in PURR when nunx is not set to the default value (when nunx is set to anything else but 0 or the number of energy points in the unresolved energy region, purr will now properly calculate the probability tables for the given number of tables spread out over the entire unresolved resonance region)
  - fixed an issue in RECONR where the wrong channel radius was used for the calculation of the phase shift
  - array sizes were increased
  - additional allocated arrays are now deallocated at the end of the subroutine in which they were created
  - added consistency checking for probability tables in ACER for continuous energy libraries

## [NJOY2016.61](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/140)
This updates the physical constants used in NJOY2016 to the CODATA2018 values recommended in the [ENDF-6 Formats Manual](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/csewg/docs/endf-manual.pdf). The manual was updated through a format proposal at CSEWG and merged in the official repository in commit [28aca81c](https://git.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/format/endf6man/-/commit/28aca81c23d96ed783efde7f3759477972040efb).

## [NJOY2016.60](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/172)
When processing new incident charged particle ENDF files, NaN values were discovered in the ACE files. This appeared to be due to an array index overflow. A parameter for the size was added so that we can more easily resize the array, and an error message was added to detect similar issues in the future.

## [NJOY2016.59](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/170)
This release fixes a minor issue in ACER. Whenever an `ACER` check run changed the library suffix for thermal scattering libraries, it was ignored. Test 61 was added to the non regression tests.

This release addresses issue [\#163](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/163).

## [NJOY2016.58](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/169)
This release fixes a processing issue for the IRDFF-II ENDF files in GROUPR.

This release addresses issue [\#124](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/124).

## [NJOY2016.57](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/160)
This release adds a number of new predefined group structures to GROUPR and ERRORR. The code used to generate these group structures is now shared between both modules.

Please note: the meaning of ign=19 in ERRORR has changed. Previously, this meant to use a user defined structure, supplemented with the group structure read from the covariance file. This option is still available as ign=-1.

## [NJOY2016.56](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/147)
This relates to changes made by the consistency checks when a checker acer run is requested. NJOY only rarely modifies data. It does so for secondary particle distributions that use LAW=4 (isotropic angular distribution and continuous tabulated energy distributions) or LAW=44 (Kalbach-Mann).

When the consis routine determines the maximum outgoing energy is too high compared to epmax, it sets the last value of the outgoing energy array to this value, and all values before it to monotonically increasing values that are lower than epmax. It then adjusts the pdf values to maintain the associated cdf. This often leads to the introduction of artificial spikes in the plots produced by acer.

This behaviour has now been modified. Whenever this problem is detected, the consis routine will now reset the first energy larger to epmax to a value slightly below it and adjust the pdf value so that the cdf value for this energy point is 1.0. All other energy points after this energy point along with their associated data is set to zero. The locators in the xss array are left unchanged.

Due to this new behaviour, and because the routine that writes the xss array does not check locators, the change routine was modified as well to verify consistency of the locators with the actual position in the xss array. Whenever the locator is inconsistent, it will either just advance to the locator (thus taking into account the gaps created by the consis routine) or issue an error when the locator points to a position lower than the current one.

The change routine was also simplified to improve its readability by adding subroutines to write a list of integers, a list of real numbers, a single integer and a single real number.

A large number of compiler warnings were also fixed in this pull request (mostly unused or uninitialised variables).

Test case 55 was added to properly test this for a LAW=44.

This release addresses issue [\#130](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/130).

## [NJOY2016.55](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/146)
For incident alpha particles, acer assumes that when MT22 is present, the MF6 entry also contains the outgoing alphas for this reaction. When an evaluation is incomplete because this outgoing particle is missing from the MF6 section, this is not detected and thus results in a corrupted ace file. This can generally happen for any incident particle type. This release detects the absence of the outgoing particle and terminates NJOY gracefully.

This release addresses issue [\#143](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/143).

## [NJOY2016.54](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/145)
A division by zero can occur in HEATR when the atomic mass of the outgoing particles in MF6 subsections in zero. As it is impossible to recover from this (i.e. we cannot guess the atomic weight the evaluator wanted to use), this release allows NJOY to exit gracefully and report the MT number and secondary particle that caused the issue.

This pull request addresses issue [\#144](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/144).

## [NJOY2016.53](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/141)
In an initial proposal for NJOY2016.51, the number of za values to be read (the nza variable) was explicitly requested in the input. This was removed in favor of reading 16 values by default and then determining how many were given. This proves problematic for NJOY21. As a result, specifying nza is now mandatory again.

## [NJOY2016.52](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/139)
An error was corrected in the calculation of the Coulomb elastic scattering cross section for incident charged particles. The issue was detected when producing an ACE file for alpha on alpha with ACER but the error also existed in GROUPR. All instances have been corrected. Tests were added for 5 cases to detect this issue in the future.

This pull request addresses issue [\#138](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/138).

## [NJOY2016.51](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/127)
Changes were made to ACER to increase the number of ZA values that go into the ACE file for a thermal scattering file from 3 to 16 values. This was an issue when one tried to specify the ZA values for a thermal scattering file such as ZrH or SiO2 (the additional ZA values were added by hand as required).

This pull request addresses issue [\#126](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/126).

## [NJOY2016.50](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/136)
Changes were made to the ACER routines for photoatomic data to fix an infinite loop when using ENDF/B-VIII.0 data and to fix the scratch array size to accommodate the current size of the ENDF data. An additional test was added to detect this problem in the future.

This pull request addresses issue [\#91](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/91) and  [\#135](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/135).

## [NJOY2016.49](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/119)
GROUPR was modified to produce MF6 MT18 data for each sigma0 value. A test was added to verify that this does not impact ERRORR processing. Other tests were modified to also provide the GROUPR GENDF file in ASCII for testing this new feature.

This pull request addresses issue [\#118](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/118)

## [NJOY2016.48](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/117)
The changes are as follows:

- a message is issued when the background plus the potential scattering, the interference and sigma0 value are negative
- a message is issued when the beta value is within the -1 to 0 range (which causes a sqrt to return NaN)

Questions:

- the first message could be slightly changed so that it is issued when the background plus the potential scattering and the interference are negative, regardless of the value of sigma0. In my opinion, the fact that this value is negative before adding sigma0 is an indication that the evaluation is no good whatever happens.
- the second message could be transformed into an error and that would stop the processing dead in its tracks (which degrades the behaviour from before these changes - it was silently ignored). In my opinion, the results will be inherently wrong, which would merit the use of error instead of mess.

This Pull Request addresses issue [\#116 (GROUPR has problems due to NaNs coming from UNRESR)](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/116). Look there for more information.

## [NJOY2016.47](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/115)
Additional fixes to the physical constants: electron and helion mass. See issue [\#106](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/106).

No impact on test results (no changes, these constants do not seem to be used in any of the tests we currently run).

## [NJOY2016.46](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/109)
This is a companion PR to [njoy/NJOY2016-manual#23](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016-manual/pull/23), updating the comment block in leapr.f90.

## [NJOY2016.45](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/113)
This should resolve issue [\#105 (A Simple Bug in NJOY2016 and NJOY2012)](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/105).

## [NJOY2016.44](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/107)
This fixes issue [\#106 (Typo in hbar)](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/issues/106)
